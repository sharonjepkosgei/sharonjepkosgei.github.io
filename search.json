This can save you time and effort compared to manually visiting the Google Trends website each time.\n\nData Processing\n\nWith gtrendsR, you can process and analyze Google Trends data directly within R, making it easier to perform complex analyses, create visualizations, and combine Google Trends data with other datasets.\n\nCustomization\n\nWhile the Google Trends website offers customization options, gtrendsR provides finer control over data retrieval parameters, such as date ranges and geographic regions. You can also specify additional query parameters not available on the website.\nExample:\nOne keyword\nplot(gtrends(“transgender”, time = “all”))\n\nAdjust geographic region\nplot(gtrends(c(“transgender”), geo = c(“US”,“GB”,“TW”), time = “all”))\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Keywords\nplot(gtrends(c(“transgender”, “women right”, “feminism”), time = “all”))"
